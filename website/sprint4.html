											<h3>Mechanical</h3>
											<p>
												The archway construction had several hiccups during its production. In the initial stages, the Shopbot
												(CNC Router) was rather finicky. There were a few small issues with firmware and such that had to be
												fixed by the NINJAs before we could continue. This, along with the fact that the wood, especially the
												5.5 mm, was slightly warped. Due to zeroing at a consistant Z-plane hight, the machine cuts slightly
												different depths on the board. Screwing down the sheet was imperitive, we had learned.
											</p>
											<p>
													For the three-quarter inch boards (really 23/32 in/measured at about 0.71), while running through
													the pockets for the wiring cavities, the machine threw an error. After a moment of investigation
													and restarting the toolpath, the Shopbot began cutting the pocket higher than before. We measured
													the new height to be correct. We suspect the previous height to be a little deeper than input due
													to either a slight zeroing error by us or the computer (as the beginning of the first toolpath was
													correct as well). The cut may have gotten slightly more and more off track as it went on.
											</p>
                                           <img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SkfcGYl_QmoN5a6FiSA7UbXPviOWx7SwcCVFduiOT5ME8iLTd0Rft5ZPasSYitmk8ltqnJc6-Nul-6j7JjiWgVXECHNrjscnwNgsazZWdSKZZSCPszqe6S8O22dTkAki2IgVgtncdg' class="image"/>
                                            
											<p>
													While cutting the cross beams, a mistake restarting at the wrong point made a decent sized pocket
													along the top. This had to be filled with wood filler and sanded before this piece could be painted.
													This definitely falls under the "measure twice cut once" lessons learned.
											</p>
                                            
                                            
											<p>
													When we finally got to the painting portion, after initial fittings to determine if all cuts were
													correct and sanding sharp parts down, we took the pieces to the composites bay to spray paint them. The team purchased 3 cans of
													spray paint and used them up in less than half an hour and only 6 "feet" and one and a half beams.
													It ended up taking 3 total trips to Home Depot, 11 cans, and looking like we huffed paint in under 24
													hours to finish all of the pieces. In retrospect, using a few brushes and a can of regular paint would
													have been more reasonable. Though timewise it would likely not have been that much faster, the choice
													would have saved an hour of driving and likely 20ish bucks in paint. While the decision to spray paint
													was based on a previous small project, the sheer amount of paint means that any proect of painting to
													this scale will be done with brush in hand.

													A suggestion during a sprint review was to use thin brass tubing on our flowers rather than the rolled
													paper we had at the time. Because brass tubing is both expensive and heavy, we decided on painting
													coffee straws the brassy color. While we love the outcome, replacing all of the tubing required
													rethreading all of the strings, costing a fair amount of time (an one member's remaining sanity).
													This gave it a more legitimate look instead of a child’s art project vibe.

													The flowers contain two servos and many laser cut pieces, making them a big weighty to mount. Early
													ideation for this was adhesives, lasercut pieces, and ultimately 3D printed mounts, which seemed most
													sturdy and logical to pursue. With the amount of time that was needed to put up so many, though, a
													just-before-bed idea from Meaghen took us back to simplicity. The vine string through the servo's
													screw holes were able to stabily mount the servo upright against a cross section on the lattice. The
													servo and wires could then easily be hidden with more origami paper.

											<h3>Electrical</h3>
											<p>
												By popular demand, we increased the number of flowers from three to five, thus increasing the number of
												servos for our configuration from six to ten. We also added two additional sensors to the other side of
												the archway in a staggered position. Even valued servos and sensors were located on the left, while odd
												valued ones were located on the right.
											</p>

                      <p>
												In order to support the sheer number of servos and sensors, we considered either switching over to an
												Arduino Due, using two Arduino Unos, or wiring servos with the same function on each side of the arch
												to the same digital port. The first option allowed for many more digital ports, but wouldn’t
												consistently work with our time-of-flight sensors. The second option would not be too difficult, but
												we decided on the third option since it would allow us to keep as much of the current configuration as
												possible for both the firmware and electrical subsystems. Thus, all the turn motors on one side were
												wired to and controlled from the same digital port, the bloom motors were attached to another port, and
												so on.
											</p>
											<p>
												Once we had the archway painted and assembled, we were able to begin attaching wires inside the hardware
												closet, trimming, twisting, and crimping them along the way. We crimped and housed all of the wires leading
												to the sensors and servos to ensure that we could easily replace or remove them as necessary. We attached
												all of the wires to the frame with Gorilla tape and labeled them with masking tape.
											</p>

											<p>
												The wires running across the top of the archway blend in with the white paint and can be unplugged from
												the rest of the system. This way, we can disassemble the archway and move it without having to unwire anything.

                      <p>
												One problem we faced with yet another increase in servos and sensors was the inevitable increase in
												current draw. Although we didn’t realize it for a while, the ten servos were past requiring two amps
												of current. This meant the laptop USB power supply was far from sufficient in powering the servos. We
												ended up moving to a desktop power supply when attempts at using other adapters didn’t work. The
												time-of-flight sensors, however, could not handle this amount of current. If it had been earlier in
												the project, we could have dealt with this by dropping the current before sending it to the sensors,
												but since most everything was already wired into the arch, we decided that powering the sensors
												directly from the Arduino was the quickest and most reliable option.
											</p>
                      <p>
												In addition, the I2C bus was no longer working due to capacitance across the length of wires over the
												arch. Although this configuration had worked in that past, the relocation of our archway and its
												newfound proximity to electromagnetic interference caused the sensors to fail when the two sensors on
												the right were wired. Thus, we removed the connection to those sensors. We later added the two sensors
												back, but this time on the left side so we could limit the wire length and interference as much as possible.
											</p>

											</p>
                      <p>
												Our configuration for this sprint is our final configuration. We kept the unused wires in the arch
												since many required unraveling to remove. It wasn’t worth the effort and they would not affect the
												system while unplugged.

											<h3>firmware</h3>
											<p>
												Last sprint’s code got updated to work with the new servo configuration (10 servos, signal sent to 4
												ategories of servos). The two sensors on the right side got integrated. More repeated lines and
												hardcoded numbers were moved into functions and variables to improve readability and decrease badness.
											</p>
											<p>
												There was a moment of panic when the system began breaking consistently after wiring in the rest of
												the servos for the flowers before we realized that the 10 servos were drawing too much current. In
												the process of rewiring into a new power supply, the two new sensors on the right side were
												deintegrated briefly, then reintegrated the next day. The current code, visible on
												<a href="https://github.com/nielsenlouise/efflorescence/">GitHub</a>, is reasonably neat, readable,
												and functional.
