											<h3>Mechanical</h3>

												The archway construction had several hiccups during its production. In the initial stages, the Shopbot (CNC Router) was rather finicky. There were a few small issues with software and such that had to be fixed by the NINJAs before we could continue. This, along with the fact that the wood, especially the 5.5 mm, was slightly warped. Due to zeroing at a consistant Z-plane hight, the machine cuts slightly different depths on the board. Screwing down the sheet was imperitive, we had learned.
											</p>
											<p>
													For the three-quarter inch boards (really 23/32 in/measured at about 0.71), while running through the pockets for the wiring cavities, the machine threw an error. After a moment of investigation and restarting the toolpath, the Shopbot began cutting the pocket higher than before. We measured the new height to be correct. We suspect the previous height to be a little deeper than input due to either a slight zeroing error by us or the computer (as the beginning of the first toolpath was correct as well). The cut may have gotten slightly more and more off track as it went on.
											</p>
											<p>
													While cutting the cross beams, a mistake restarting at the wrong point made a decent sized pocket along the top. This had to be filled with wood filler and sanded before this piece could be painted. This definitely falls under the "measure twice cut once" lessons learned.
											</p>
											<p>
													When we finally got to the painting portion, after initial fittings to determine if all cuts were correct, we took the pieces to the composites bay to spray paint them. The team purchased 3 cans of spray paint and used them up in less than half an hour and only 6 "feet" and one and a half beams. It ended up taking 3 total trips to Home Depot, 11 cans, and looking like we huffed paint in under 24 hours to finish all of the pieces. In retrospect, using a few brushes and a can of regular paint would have been more reasonable. Though timewise it would likely not have been that much faster, the choice would have saved an hour of driving and likely 20ish bucks in paint. While the decision to spray paint was based on a previous small project, the sheer amount of paint means that any proect of painting to this scale will be done with brush in hand.
											</p>
											<p>
													A suggestion during a sprint review was to use thin brass tubing on our flowers rather than the rolled paper we had at the time. Because brass tubing is both expensive and heavy, we decided on painting coffee straws the brassy color. While we love the outcome, replacing all of the tubing required rethreading all of the strings, costing a fair amount of time (an one member's remaining sanity). This gave it a more legitimate look instead of a child’s art project vibe.

											</p>
											<p>
													The flowers contain two servos and many laser cut pieces, making them a big weighty to mount. Early ideation for this was adhesives, lasercut pieces, and ultimately 3D printed mounts, which seemed most sturdy and logical to pursue. With the amount of time that was needed to put up so many, though, a just-before-bed idea from Meaghen took us back to simplicity. The vine string through the servo's screw holes were able to stabily mount the servo upright against a cross section on the lattice. The servo and wires could then easily be hidden with more origami paper.

												Last sprint’s code got updated to work with the new servo configuration (10 servos, signal sent to 4 categories of servos). The two sensors on the right side got integrated. More repeated lines and hardcoded numbers were moved into functions and variables to improve readability and decrease badness. Then, all the sudden everything broke and we shouldn’t forget to update this later when it’s more resolved.
