											<h2>Sprint 2</h2>
										</header>
										<section>
											<p>
												This sprint, we wanted to make a prototyped archway with a pretty flower than blooms and turns after a “trip-wire” near the entry to the archway is triggered. We also wanted to ideate aesthetic archways, research speakers, and get our website on the PoE server. Additionally, we finally decided what our aesthetic would be. We’re aiming for an elegant, graceful final product with vibrantly colored, delicate, and bioinspired flowers on an intricate but robust wooden archway. We say nothing here of the wiring or other components because they should be hidden. The archway is currently our largest technical risk. We are concerned about making an archway that is both “intricate and robust” and capable of supporting and fitting the flowers and hiding the speakers, camera, raspi, arduino, and other circuitry.

											<h3>Mechanical</h3>
											<p>
												We made a flower that blooms but not as bad this time. Now it’s mainly 3D printed which keeps it pretty light but makes it more durable, more professional looking, and adds color. We got real hinges. The petals are made out of paper and are designed to look similar to real petals. The paper adds a feel of lightness and delicateness. There is also an attachment which allows a second servo motor to hide behind the flower and turn it left and right, so now it can both bloom and turn.
											</p>

										<section>
											<h3>Electrical</h3>
											<p>
												Like in the first sprint, we used a servo to rotate the center of the flower, either pulling the petals towards it so it closes or pushing the petals outwards so it blooms. We also wired a servo motor for lateral motion. We rested most of this motor inside the cardboard arch, allowing us to attach the flower to the arch while hiding its wires. With the arduino and breadboard also inside the archway, we cut two holes for the wires of each motor to be contained inside the archway. We also wired a speaker through the bottom of the arch, where the arduino and breadboard were located, to the top of the arch, where the user can experience surround sound. We did not have enough time to integrate the raspi camera, so we reused the IR sensor as a tripwire, cutting a hole near the bottom of the archway for the sensor inside to detect the motion of someone walking by. Since we needed to calibrate our system to the archway, we wired the USB connecting to the arduino out of the archway to connect to a laptop for calibration purposes as well as power.
